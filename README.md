The repository is structured into three main directories:
- `Data` : Contains various datasets used in the study.
- `Script` : Includes R code for analysis and graph generation.
- `Graph` : Stores the final visual outputs produced.

The analyses were conducted in a `R` environment and are saved as `.R` files, with each analysis documented in a separate file. Graphs and scripts not included in the main text can be found in the `NotUsed` folder.
